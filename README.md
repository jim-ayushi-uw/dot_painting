# 🎨 Dot Painting with Python
> A turtle-based rendition of Hirst-inspired dot painting 🟣🔵🟢 using just Python and creativity.

## 🚀 What is This?

This project generates a vibrant **dot painting** using Python’s built-in `turtle` graphics. It uses a pre-defined (or extracted) color palette to draw a grid of colorful dots — like pixel art, but painted with joy.
